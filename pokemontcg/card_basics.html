                <p>There are many elements in a card and this section is made to tell you what they mean. In the top right corner we see the pokemons health which is represented by HP (hit points) and the type which is represented by the little symbol in the circle in the top right corner. The top left indicates the name of the pokemon and what stage which will either be basic, stage 1, or stage 2. Below the pokemon's picture is where you will find the pokemons attacks and abilities. these attacks will often have an attack cost next to them which will require you to have the correct type and amount of energy before you are able to use that attack. unnder the attack name will usually be a description of what the attack does followed by how much  damage the attack does off to the right of the card. At the bottom of the card is a bar that will show if the pokemon is resistant or weak to another type of pokemon in this case the pokemon is 2x weak to fire type moves. On the left will be the retreat cost which is how much energy you must take off the pokemon in order to return it and play another pokemon.

                <p>The information above is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to card knowledge. In addition to pokemon style cards, there are cards such as items cards and supporter cards that allow you to power up your pokemon and make your attacks stronger. Certain types of pokemon cards are more rare than others these cards are often refered to as ultra rare pokemon cards and often have super powerful attacks and are often paired with large amounts of hp these cards often have special rules along with them. There are many different features about pokemon cards and all different kinds of varieties that I didnt go over in this page, the best way to learn how to play with these cards is to go out and play the game with friends or even online to help you better understand the game and how different cards interact with each other to have a better understanding of the game.

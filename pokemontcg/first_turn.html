        <h2>Your First Turn</h2>
        <p>The game starts with a coin flip. The winner of the coin flip will decide if they want to go first or second. After selecting who goes first both players will draw 7 cards. Out of those 7 cards each player will play a basic pokemon from their hand and place it into the active spot. After chosing your active pokemon both players will then take 6 cards form the top of their deck and place them face down as prize cards to the left of their play feild. poth players after placing their prize card will flip their cards over. Now the player who was decided to go first can do a number of things. they may draw a card (once at the begining of your turn), attatch an energy from their hand (once per turn), play a basic pokemon from your hand to your bench (up to 5 pokemon), play an item card from your hand (as many as you would like), play a supporter card (once per turn), evolve a pokemon (as many as you would like), and attack (once at the end of your turn). The objective of your turn should be to power up your pokemon using energy in order to attack your opponents pokemon and doing enough damage to them so that they no longer have any hitpoints. If you attack at the end of your turn and your opponents pokemon has no more HP then that pokemon is knocked out and you select a prizecard from your prizecard section. The game is over when you no longer have prize cards remaining, a player has no more cards in their deck to draw a card at the begining of their turn, or a player has no more pokemon on their bench after the active pokemon has been knocked out.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bolded">Why use my site:</span> People will come to my site if they are interested in Pok√©mon and want to learn about how they can have fun playing the card game. People may just have a surplus of cards lying around and want to know more about the cards and why they look the way they look and what they do. <br>
        <span class="bolded">What questions will my site answer:</span> Some questions that will be able to be answered from my website is how to play the game that the pokemon trading card game was meant for and also what different types of cards there are and what the different numbers and how to tell the difference between a trainer and a pokemon and an item card so that you can more easily understand the game but also hopefully progress your skills enough to become good at the game as well. <br>
        <span class="bolded">Why my site instead of another:</span> People will most likely visit my site instead of others because mine will have character and unlike other sites which can be confusing my site will explain the game in a way that everyone will be able to understand. <br>
        <span class="bolded">The home page:</span> The home page will show basic background information about what someone will be able to learn from my site and will also show navigation links to my two pages where you will be able to gain knowledge about what the things of a card mean and also how you start a game, the materials you need to play and also how to perform your first turn and how the game is won at its most basic level and will also briefly go over more advanced cards in the game and how you can further continue playing the game and progressing.

      <h3>Card Basics</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bolded">Card Basics page:</span> this page will contain information on what the different values numbers and words of a card mean and how cards can interact with other cards. It will focus on things like HP and retreat cost and energy costs to use and attack and how you can use cards and why some cards are better than other cards <br>
        <span class="bolded">Other information:</span> there are so many different things to learn about the cards that it would be overwhelming to explain every little detail about the cards so I will explain that there are many other different cards that are more rare that will be able to be played with and that continuing to play the game and explore will help them to understand these cards as well

      <h3>Your First Turn</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bolded">First turn page:</span> In this page I will show the players the layout of the table and how they start and play through their first turn with information that they learned in the cards basics page they should be able to complete and get through all of the necessary parts of the first turn and also give a brief explanation of things that change on turns after the first turn. (example: you can not play a supporter card if you go first) <br>
        <span class="bolded">Other game mechanics:</span> the first turn page will also talk about other very important mechanics in the game like how to use special abilities and when you can use them. There are also things like special conditions with several different categories that I will breifly touch on in this tab and most importantly I will talk about prize cards and how the game is eventually won and show the mechanics that special pokemon will be able to use throughout games. There is also a great amount of luck involved in the pokemon trading card game so I will explain the need for a die and other materials that will make the game much easier to play for a beginner to the game

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Home page will include a menu with 3 main pictures at the top which will allow the visitor to navigate the site the circle near the bottom will be a pokeball that will show a mission statement type thing in the text box near a picture of pokemon cards placed next to it.
      </p>
      <img src="homegrid.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Card basics</h3>
      <p>         
        Again the large circle will be a pokeball and I will make the colors so that the text will be visible and also will reduce visibility of the ball to create less noise and not have things look so sloppy.
      </p>
      <img src="Basics.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>Your First Turn</h3>
      <p>         
        The large picture at the top will be a play map of a pokemon card game along with, at the bottom, there will be an image depicting special conditions of pokemon along with a box for each condition and a breif explanation.
